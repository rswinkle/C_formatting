This is a python script that converts C/C++ files to The One True Brace style (OTBS).
It is still a work in progress, and I have several ideas for improvements and of course I need to clean up the code.

You can probably tell that I'm a C/C++ programmer who is not familiar with pythonic methods of doing things.  That's
another reason I'm doing this project, just to learn regular expressions and get more experience with python and some
of it's libraries.

At the same time I think having a tool to automatically convert any C/C++ project to my prefered style is pretty awesome.
