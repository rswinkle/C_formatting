This is a python script that converts C/C++ files to the One True Brace Style (OTBS).
It currently works (though it needs to be more strenuously tested) but it is still a
work in progress, and I have several ideas for improvements/features and of course I need to clean up the code.

You can probably tell that I'm a C/C++ programmer who is not very familiar with pythonic
methods of doing things.  That's another reason I'm doing this project, just to learn
regular expressions and get more experience with Python and some of it's libraries.

At the same time I think having a tool to automatically convert any C/C++ project to my preferred style is pretty awesome.
